# SequelProBundles
This is a collection of bundles I've written for Sequel Pro.

They are organized by type.

# Install Instructions
1. Clone the repo, or download it as a zip file and unzip it.
2. Ensure SequelPro is running. (nominally not required, but I've had better luck if it's already open then if it isn't.)
3. Double Click on the `.spbundle` file for the bundle you wish to install.
4. Follow the usage directions in the README file for the type of bundle you are installing
5. Repeat for other bundles
